# Recsys Techniques — Quick Reference

A concise reference for the methods implemented in this project. Each maps to a
file in `src/recsys/models/` and a notebook in `notebooks/`.

## The core architecture: retrieval → ranking

Modern recommenders are **two stages**:

```
request → RETRIEVAL (fast, high recall) → ~100s candidates
        → RANKING (slower, high precision) → top-K shown
```

- **Retrieval**: cut millions of items to a few hundred. Optimizes *recall*.
- **Ranking**: carefully re-order that short list with rich features. Optimizes *precision* (NDCG).

Every model below is either a retriever, a ranker, or a baseline that does both in one shot.

## Models (in build order)

## Collaborative filtering — method classes

### Memory-based CF

**User-user CF**: find users with similar rating vectors (cosine or Pearson), recommend what they liked. Doesn't scale — user space is large and the matrix is sparse.

**Item-item CF**: find items similar to what a user has interacted with. Item similarities are precomputed and stable → scales better than user-user. Amazon's original algorithm.

**Why memory-based fails at scale**: the rating matrix is extremely sparse (most users rate <0.1% of items), so similarity estimates are unreliable.

---

### Matrix factorization

**SVD / FunkSVD**: decompose `R ≈ U·Vᵀ`, minimize squared error on *observed* ratings via SGD. Classic for explicit feedback (star ratings).

**ALS (Alternating Least Squares)**: same decomposition but solves U and V alternately in closed form. Handles implicit feedback with confidence weighting: `c_ui = 1 + α·r_ui` where `r_ui = 1` if the user interacted, 0 otherwise. Fast, parallelizable, still used in production. **Alternate** means: freeze items → solve users (least squares) → freeze users → solve items → repeat.

**BPR (Bayesian Personalized Ranking)**: optimizes pairwise ranking — observed items should rank above unobserved. Loss: `Σ -log σ(x̂_ui - x̂_uj)` for (u, i, j) where i is observed, j is not. Better objective than pointwise MSE for implicit data.

---

### Neural CF

**NCF / NeuMF**: replaces the dot product in MF with an MLP, learning non-linear user×item interactions. Outperforms pure MF on dense datasets.

**Two-tower (dual encoder)**: separate neural networks for user and item → shared embedding space. Score = dot product. The standard for *retrieval at scale*: item embeddings are precomputed once, ANN (FAISS/ScaNN) retrieves top-K in milliseconds.

Trained with **in-batch negatives** (sampled softmax): within a batch of (user, positive-item) pairs, every other item is a negative. Popularity bias: popular items appear as negatives more often → their scores get suppressed. Corrected with logQ correction or hard negative mining.

The item tower is where text/image/graph/social features get injected.

---

### Sequential / session-based CF

Models the *order* of interactions, not just the set. No persistent user embedding — user is their recent history window.

**GRU4Rec**: RNN over item sequence. First neural sequential rec paper.

**SASRec**: self-attention (transformer decoder) over item sequences. Faster than RNN, captures long-range dependencies. Current strong baseline.

**BERT4Rec**: bidirectional transformer with masked item prediction (BERT-style pretraining). Slightly stronger than SASRec on dense data, slower.

Use when: recency and order matter (e-commerce, streaming, news). Less useful when taste is stable over long periods.

---

### Graph-based CF

**LightGCN**: propagates user and item embeddings over the user–item bipartite graph via weighted sum (no non-linearity). Final embedding = average across propagation layers. Strong on sparse data; captures multi-hop signals. Expensive — full graph must be in memory.

**Social CF (GraphRec, DiffNet)**: adds the social/friend graph as a second propagation path. Helps cold-start users who have friends with rich histories.

---

### Factorization machines (ranker stage)

**FM**: generalizes MF to arbitrary feature vectors. Models all pairwise feature interactions: `ŷ = w₀ + Σwᵢxᵢ + Σᵢ<ⱼ <vᵢ,vⱼ>xᵢxⱼ`. Interaction term is O(nk) via the FM trick (not O(n²)).

**DeepFM**: FM (2nd-order interactions) + DNN (higher-order) sharing the same input embeddings. Used as a ranker in production systems.

---

### When to use what

| Situation | Method |
|---|---|
| Explicit ratings, small scale | SVD / ALS |
| Implicit, millions of items | Two-tower retrieval → BPR/LambdaRank ranker |
| Sequential behavior matters | SASRec / BERT4Rec |
| Rich side features available | DeepFM / two-tower with feature inputs |
| Social/graph signal available | LightGCN or social feature in ranker |
| Cold start | Content tower (text/image) + popularity fallback |

---

## Key concepts

### Implicit vs explicit feedback
- **Explicit**: ratings/stars (user directly states preference). Clean signal, rare — most users don't rate things.
- **Implicit**: preference inferred from behavior — a purchase, click, play, or review existing regardless of score. Noisy but abundant. Most production systems run on implicit data.

| | Explicit | Implicit |
|---|---|---|
| What you observe | Actual preference score | Binary interaction (seen / not seen) |
| Unobserved = | Missing data | Weakly negative (probably not relevant) |
| Loss function | MSE on observed ratings | Confidence-weighted MSE (ALS) or pairwise ranking (BPR) |
| Metric | RMSE | Recall@K, NDCG@K |

**Why use ALS as implicit even when star ratings exist (e.g. Yelp)?**
The task is *what to recommend next*, not *what score will they give*. Using implicit:
1. Lets you model the 99.9% of unreviewed items ("didn't interact = probably not relevant") — explicit MF ignores unobserved entries entirely.
2. Is more robust to selection bias: people rate things they already chose to visit, so the rating distribution is not a random sample of preferences.
3. The *act* of reviewing is the relevance signal; the star value feeds downstream (as a ranker feature or `positive_threshold` filter), not into retrieval.

Typical production split of rating signals:
- **Retrieval** (ALS / two-tower): implicit — did they interact?
- **Ranker**: uses stars as a feature (`user_avg_rating`, `item_avg_rating`, `rating_gap`)
- **Rating prediction**: separate model only if the product needs to display a predicted score

### ALS (Alternating Least Squares)
See matrix factorization above.

### Two-tower + in-batch negatives
See neural CF above.

### GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine)
Build many small decision trees **sequentially**, each correcting the previous ensemble's errors (defined by the loss **gradient**). LightGBM/HistGradientBoosting are implementations.
- **`lambdarank`** objective = *listwise* learning-to-rank: optimizes item **order** within each user's candidate list (NDCG). This is LambdaMART-style.
- Pointwise fallback (sklearn `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`) predicts a score per item independently — simpler, weaker ranking signal.

### Social recommendation
`score(u,i) = (1-α)·Σ_friends trust(u,f)·liked(f,i) + α·popularity(i)`
- **trust**: `uniform` (all friends equal) or `jaccard` (share of common items).
- Popularity back-off handles friendless/cold users.
- Best used as a **feature into the ranker** (`use_social=True`), not standalone.

### ALS vs BPR (same factors, different loss)
- **ALS**: pointwise. Reconstructs a confidence-weighted preference matrix. Strong when interaction counts are informative.
- **BPR**: pairwise. For each (user, observed i, unobserved j), push `score(u,i) > score(u,j)`. Directly optimizes ranking.
- Run both on the same split (`ALSRecommender` vs `BPRRecommender`) to isolate the objective. Library-matched via `implicit`.

### SASRec (sequence vs set)
Static user embeddings (ALS, two-tower id table) average a user's whole history into one vector. That breaks when:
- intent is session-local (just browsed sushi → next rec should shift)
- taste drifts over time
- order of interactions matters more than the bag of items

SASRec replaces the user embedding with a **causal transformer over the recent item sequence**. Training target = next item at each position. Inference = last hidden state · item embedding matrix. Implemented in `sasrec.py`. In the unified two-stage, SASRec is also used as a **ranker feature** (`use_sasrec=True`): it scores candidates from the fused pool without adding a fifth retriever.

### Generative vs discriminative recommendation

| | **Discriminative** (most of this repo) | **Generative** |
|---|---|---|
| **Question** | How relevant is item *i* for user *u*? | What item(s) should we show user *u*? |
| **Output** | A score per (user, item) pair | The recommendation(s) directly |
| **Serving** | Score candidates → sort → top-K | Model *emits* items (tokens or text) |
| **Examples here** | ALS, BPR, two-tower, SASRec, LightGBM ranker | `ItemTokenLMRecommender` |

**Discriminative path (production default):** retrieve ~200 candidates → score each → re-rank. Even SASRec is discriminative at inference: it dot-products the sequence embedding against *all* item embeddings, then takes top-K.

**Generative path — item-token LM** (`item_token_lm.py`): each item id is a vocabulary token. A causal transformer is trained with next-token cross-entropy on user histories. At inference the model **autoregressively decodes** item tokens one at a time (append each pick to context, predict the next) — it generates the list instead of scanning the catalog. Cold/empty users fall back to popularity.

**Generative-adjacent — LLM reranker** (`llm_reranker.py`): still discriminative in the pipeline (candidates in, sorted list out), but the *scoring function* is language-native. `LLMReranker` builds a short text history ("User recently enjoyed: …") and scores each candidate's item text with a cross-encoder (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2`, or bi-encoder / token-overlap fallback). `LLMTwoStageRecommender` = retriever → `LLMReranker`. Useful when you want LLM-style relevance judgment without training a GBM ranker — and without generating the full catalog from scratch.

**When to use which:** discriminative retrieve+rank is still the reliable production pattern. Item-token LMs are the research direction toward unified generative rec (TIGER, LC-Rec, etc.). LLM rerankers are a pragmatic middle ground: language understanding on a *small* candidate pool.

### Text embeddings + cold start
Collaborative models cannot score an item with zero interactions. Content can:
1. **Standalone** (`ContentBasedRecommender`): embed item text (sentence-transformers, or TF-IDF+SVD fallback) → user vector = mean of liked-item embeddings → cosine. `cold_item_ids()` lists catalog items never seen in train.
2. **In the retriever** (`ContentTwoTowerRecommender`): item tower = MLP([id_emb ; text_emb]). Cold items are still embeddable (mean id-embedding + their text), so retrieval degrades gracefully as the catalog turns over — the usual production answer to "how do you handle new items?".

### Cold-start, done honestly: one model, three slices (the headline result)
The claim worth testing is "**one** pipeline handles warm users/items, cold items, **and** cold users." You don't get to retrain per regime — so we train **once**, then score the *same* recommendations against four views of the test set (`scripts/benchmark.py`):

- Slices: **warm** (user & item both seen in train), **cold-item** (target item unseen in train), **cold-user** (user unseen in train). Overlap (cold user *and* cold item) is dropped for clean attribution.

**Main construction — natural coldness via a global-time split.** The headline dataset is the *cross-regime* slice (`scripts/make_crossregime.py` → `data/processed_philly_xreg/`): keep the dense Philadelphia core, then inject a real low-activity tail of items and users whose activity is entirely *after* a global cutoff `T`. Evaluate with a single wall-clock split (`global_temporal_split`, cutoff at the 90th time percentile):

```
train = interactions with t <= T        test = interactions with t > T
cold_items = test items not in train    cold_users = test users not in train
```

Because the injected tail is first-seen after `T`, it has **zero** training history — genuinely cold, no carve-out. Unlike a per-user split (which leaves every user with train history and so can never produce a cold *user*), one global cutoff makes both cold items and cold users arise naturally. Run `python scripts/benchmark.py` on the cross-regime slice.

**Results** (cross-regime Philadelphia, recall@20 — `python scripts/benchmark.py`):

| model | overall | warm | cold-item | cold-user |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| popularity | 0.046 | 0.044 | 0.000 | 0.069 |
| als / bpr | 0.017 | 0.027 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| sasrec | 0.037 | **0.060** | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| two_stage | 0.023 | 0.039 | 0.000 | 0.000 |
| item_token_lm | — | — | — | — |
| two_stage_llm | — | — | — | — |
| **two_stage_unified** | **0.052** | 0.052 | 0.000 | **0.087** |

*`item_token_lm` and `two_stage_llm` are in `benchmark.py` full mode; re-run to fill rows.*

The unified two-stage (`MultiRetriever[two-tower + content_based + social + popularity] → ranker`, see `scripts/benchmark.py::build_unified_two_stage`) wins on **overall and cold-user**; SASRec is strongest on warm among single-signal models.

**\*The cold-item finding (a real one, unchanged by the natural slice).** Injecting *real* cold items makes the slice statistically credible; it does **not** raise the score. Cold-item recall stays low because it's the *data*, not the ranker: Yelp item text is only `name + categories` (~75 chars, e.g. `"Tuna Bar. Sushi Bars, Restaurants, Japanese"`), which clusters items by cuisine but can't pinpoint the specific next business. Content-cosine barely separates relevant cold items (0.667 vs 0.625 warm), so few cold targets even reach the candidate pool. Attempts to force it (content-score ranker feature, cold-feature dropout, round-robin fusion) didn't help and slightly hurt the other slices — you can't rank cold items the retriever never surfaces, and you can't teach a ranker cold behavior when training has zero cold positives. **Text-based cold-start works only when the text is discriminative** (product descriptions, review text, news bodies), not 3-word category lists. *Extension point:* aggregate real Yelp **review text** per business into the item text to raise the ceiling.

## Evaluation (do this right or nothing else matters)

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| **Temporal split** (train on past, test on future) | Random splits leak the future and inflate scores. |
| **Recall@K** | Did relevant items make the top-K? (retrieval quality) |
| **NDCG@K** | Are relevant items ranked high? (ranking quality) |
| **HitRate@K** | Did *any* relevant item appear? |
| **Coverage@K** | How much of the catalog gets shown? (diversity / anti-popularity-bias) |
| **Slice by user activity** (`evaluate_by_activity`) | Social/content signals usually help **sparse** users most; averages hide this. |

**The golden question for every new model:** *does it beat a well-tuned baseline?* If not, that's a finding — not a failure.

---

## Synthetic vs real data (important caveat)

The synthetic generator builds the friend graph partly from latent taste, so a
"social helps" result on synthetic data only validates the **mechanics**. The
honest scientific test needs the **real Yelp friend graph** (friendships formed
independently of ratings). Same code — just point `load_dataset()` at the Yelp
subset (`scripts/make_subset.py`).

---

## Benchmark results (synthetic, recall@10 / ndcg@10)

| Model | recall@10 | ndcg@10 |
|---|---|---|
| popularity | 0.059 | 0.044 |
| als | 0.229 | 0.209 |
| two_tower | 0.288 | 0.244 |
| item_cf | 0.335 | 0.316 |
| two_stage (no social) | 0.360 | 0.325 |
| **two_stage + social** | **0.395** | **0.363** |

Takeaways: two-stage beats retrieval-alone; social adds a further lift as a ranker feature. Re-run on real Yelp for the honest numbers.

> Numbers are on synthetic data (mechanics check). The synthetic friend graph is
> built partly from latent taste, so treat the social lift as illustrative until
> reproduced on the real Yelp friend graph.

## Senior / Staff MLE — analyses to run (and how to talk about them)

Use this repo's **cross-regime benchmark** as the backbone. Interviewers at senior+
care less about "we tried X" and more about **attribution, tradeoffs, and honest limits**.

### 1. Regime attribution (you already have the setup)
**Question:** *Which signal helps which population?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| Four-view table | overall / warm / cold-item / cold-user per model |
| Unified vs components | unified beats any single retriever on blended metric |
| Per-retriever ablation | drop one arm from MultiRetriever; which slice drops most? |
| Ranker feature ablation | social off, sasrec off, content_score off |

**Sound bite:** "We don't ask one model to win everywhere — we measure where each signal earns its place."

### 2. Feature / data ablation (Tier 1 priority)
**Question:** *Is the bottleneck architecture or data?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| name+categories vs +review text | cold_item_r@20 before/after `review_text.py` |
| Candidate pool diagnostics | % of cold-item test targets that reach top-200 candidates |
| Content score separation | cosine(relevant cold) vs cosine(irrelevant cold) |

**Sound bite:** "Cold-item failed at retrieval, not ranking — item text wasn't discriminative."

### 3. Latency–quality–cost tradeoff
**Question:** *Would you ship this?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| fit+rec time per model | already in `benchmarks.md` |
| Unified vs SASRec-only on warm | is 3× runtime worth +0.005 warm recall? |
| LLM reranker cost | cross-encoder calls = users × candidates |

**Sound bite:** "SASRec as ranker feature gives warm lift without a fifth retriever training loop at serving."

### 4. Exposure bias / debiasing (Tier 3 scaffold)
**Question:** *Are you just learning popularity?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| IPS-weighted recall | `eval/debias.py` — down-weight easy popular hits |
| Popularity baseline gap | raw vs debiased lift for unified on cold-user |
| Coverage@K vs recall | diversity cost of unified |

**Sound bite:** "Popularity wins cold-user partly by exposure — here's debiased lift."

### 5. Diversity vs relevance (Tier 3 scaffold)
**Question:** *What does the user actually see?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| MMR sweep | λ from 0→1: NDCG vs catalog coverage Pareto curve |
| Category redundancy | avg same-category count in top-10 |

**Sound bite:** "We can trade 2% NDCG for 2× coverage without touching the ranker."

### 6. Sequential / generative positioning
**Question:** *Why not one big generative model?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| SASRec vs item_token_lm | warm slice; generative decode vs dot-product |
| LLM reranker vs GBM | same candidates, language vs tabular features |
| Semantic IDs (future) | cold-item vs flat token LM |

**Sound bite:** "Generative is complementary — we use LM scoring on a small pool, not full-catalog generation."

### 7. Statistical honesty
**Question:** *How confident are you?*

| Analysis | What to show |
|---|---|
| Seed variance | 3 runs of unified; report mean ± std on key slices |
| Slice size | n cold users (346), n cold items (223) — enough to trust? |
| Global vs per-user split | why global split matters for cold-user |

**Sound bite:** "Injected tail gives credible cold counts; we don't simulate coldness."

### 8. Production mapping (staff-level)
**Question:** *How does this become a system?*

Draw the serving diagram:
```
MultiRetriever (parallel) → candidate pool → GBM ranker (+ SASRec/social features)
                         → optional LLM rerank on top-80
                         → MMR diversity → business rules
```
Mention: logging, online A/B, candidate cache, cold-user fallback path (popularity).

### Interview checklist (bring one slide per row)
1. **Problem** — one dataset, three regimes (warm / cold-item / cold-user)
2. **Baseline** — popularity + ALS + per-user temporal (why not enough)
3. **Architecture** — unified MultiRetriever + ranker; generative as optional layer
4. **Key finding** — collaborative ~0 on cold; unified wins overall + cold-user
5. **Honest limit** — cold-item = data; review text is the next experiment
6. **Ablation** — SASRec feature / social / content arm removals
7. **Cost** — runtime table; ranker-feature vs retriever tradeoff
8. **Next** — review enrichment → IPS eval → diversity Pareto
